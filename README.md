These are ideas from various stages of pre-production. Many of them were snatched from books, articles, other productions, and podcasts. I don't necessarily agree with all of them, and some may contradict others. Each note interested me. 

## General
- Three people tell Lear the truth. Cordelia with silence (disowned), Kent with bluntness (banished), and the Fool with jokes (tolerated/liked). Only the Fool does it indirectly. The Fool is "all licenses," but what if he loses his license. What if he's been buffooning Goneril and others for years (under Lear's protection) and they've never liked it. And now they're in power.
- The end of the play takes place in Summer 
- I.i. Kent and Gloucester are concerned with the husbands, not the elder sisters, and they say nothing about Cordelia's share of the kingdom, maybe because she's unmarried. Is it surprise when Lear divides his kingdom into *three* parts?
- With all stripped away (Gloucester even gets sight stripped away), one becomes a Poor Tom. "Is man no more than this?" "The thing itself" "Unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art." Sanity is a kind of clothing.
- "In many productions, Lear enters Tom's hovel, but this is contrary to the text"
- "It is no accident that Shakespeare's most terrific drama revolves around the failure and falsity of words" -- Ted Hughes
- Love comes from nothing--from that place where everything else is abscent, laid bare. Cordelia is "most rich being poor"
- "Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say" -- Edgar
- There's a movement in the play from what-Lear-does to what's-done-to-Lear
- Kermode: "the consequence of a human tendency to evil, inflicted on the good by the bad; it can reduce humanity to a bestial condition, under an apparently indifferent heaven."
- Love enables Lear to die unselfishly -- Wells 
- Verse gets more irregular as the play progresses
- The play is "a fight towards love" -- Jonathan Kent. 
- "Lear moves from transactional relatedness, through madness into compassionate love for the daughter who returns his devotion." -- Gail MP
- Five characters in the play have everything taken away from them and must start over from scratch: Lear, Cordelia, Gloucester, Edgar, and Kent. (And the Fool?)
- Lear is a play about negation. Lear gains by being stripped of everything. Anger -> grief.

## Lear
- King vs Old Man
- Humiliation is important in the play. Kent in the stock -- humiliating for Lear, too. Seeing that, Lear must act. Kent wants Lear to do something about the stocks.
- Lear has to be stripped of everything to appreciate the love of his daughter--a love without ceremony. Ceremony (structure) was needed to keep him from madness. Without structure, through madness, there's love. 
- Has Lear *just* lost his wife? Has Cordelia *just* lost her mother?
- Maybe Lear, knowing his mind is going, wants to retain power but is scared he won't be able to. So he decided to have a different kind of power--that of the revered, retired ruler. He needs his daughters to help create this illusion. Cordelia refuses. 
- Lear's entire plan for retirement rested on living with Cordelia. She totally shatters his future. Did the older sisters count on that, too? Now they're saddled with dad? Does Goneril believe Lear's curse--that it will be effective? Is that when she becomes his enemy? 
- Lear's knights are the last thing that keeps him king. Without them, he is an "unaccommidated man." That is the scariest thing possible for a man who has only slenderly known himself. Lear is terrified of knowing himself. Can anyone tell me who I am? Is the play about Lear meeting himself? Is "give me the mirror" the culmination?
- that we our largest bounty may extend -- planned or in-the-moment?
- lear "slenderly knows himself" *and* has flashes of insight and self-knowledge. Did he fear that he was going mad before the start of the play?
-  O let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
  Keep me in temper, I would not be mad.
- Is *that* the heart of the play? Is it about trying to keep a monster contained, pushing it away, and--maybe--unleashing it and accepting it?
- "Hysteria, passio, down, thou climbing sorrow"
- "I prthee, daughter, do not make me mad" (Barely holding something together. A fragile fence holding back a raging bear. An attempt not to vomit.)
- "O Fool I shall go mad"
- "My wits begin to turn" -- sanity is ok and maybe madness is too. The horror is that space in-between when one's wits begin to turn.
- What does madness mean to Lear? What is he scared of?
-  "All other titles thou has stripped away. The title of fool that wast born with"
- "Majest falls to folly"
- "Though had little wit in thy bald crown when thou givest thy golden one away" -- a natural crown and a civilized crown
- Old age is a stripping away--a diminishment
- If Lear dismisses his followers, he's left just with himself. (And eventually Cordelia.)
- Lear mentions "thy mother's tomb" to Regan
- Lear, without questioning his own rightness, imposes his will on others; Gloucester accepts the will of others, without effectively questioning their rightness -- Heilman
- "\[Lear's] madness is an odd mixture of delusion and piercing sanity" -- Jonathan Kent
- The last decision Lear makes is going out into thje storm ... and then he starts to enjoy himself. He enjoys quite a lot of acts three and four.
- A king is protected/annointed/connected-to the gods. If a king abdicates, he becomes just a man--unprotected, no longer special. Lear is tired of being king but tries to hold onto his status with the title. He neither wants to stay or move on. And he stops the kingdom from being able to, either.
- Psychoanalyst: Lear gets off on anger in an almost sexual way. He whips himself into rages. 
- In the Poor Tom scene: "'twas this flesh begot / Those pelican daughters." possible realization line. They are me. "The obstinacy of Cordelia is me. So is the cruelty of Goneril."
- Lear oscilates between moments of insight, moments of concern for others, and selfish moments where he feels everything is against him.
- 

## Sisters
- Lear's entire plan for retirement rested on living with Cordelia. She totally shatters his future. Did the older sisters count on that, too? Now they're saddled with dad? Does Goneril believe Lear's curse--that it will be effective? Is that when she becomes his enemy?
- Cordelia has royally fucked her sisters. Lear tells Kent "IÂ loved her \[Cordelia] most, and thought to set my rest  / On her kind nursery." Now Goneril and Regan are now stuck with dad. This was finally their chance to be independent of him, but now Lear says to Goneril, Regan, and their husbands "Ourself, by monthly course,  / With reservation of an hundred knights,  / By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode / Make with you by due turns." Gonerial then says to Cordelia, "You have obedience scanted." 
- Lear comes to stay with Regan without any notice. Goneril barely gets notice.
- Is "I will do such thing -- What they are I know not" a first for Lear? A totally confusion at what to do next?
- Jonathan Kent on Goneril and Regan: "They're trying to deal with an impossible situation, with a man who has abdicated all responsibility yet at the same time wants all the privileges of position, and this makes their assumption of responsibility impossible. I don't think it's a desire to revenge themselves on someone who's clearly been a ghastly father; it's peopel fighting for their political lives."

## Goneril
- Goneril never speaks in metaphor. She lists examples. She is straightforward and tightly wound. 
- Goneril has had to be the mother. 
- Does Goneril believe Lear's curse--that it will be effective? Is that when she becomes his enemy? 
- \[Lear curses Goneril's] identity as the future mother of heirs, calling for no child to emerge from her derogate body. Her reaction suggests that she still believes that his curse will be fulfilled with the same effect as those issued when he was in charge of his kingdom. Any remaining wish for reconciliation in Goneril's heart turns from fear into malevolence as she seeks power over Lear's mind in the way he has claimed it over her reproductive life. Her father now openly be- comes her adversary and she strives to empower herself against him. R.A. Foakes, in footnotes to the Arden text, observes that Shakespeare's conception of Goneril seems to change. From this point after Lear's call for the destruction of her capacity for mothering and with it the milk of human kindness, it is difficult to find trace of human kindness in her.  -- from Gail McCracken Price's program note
- Goneril says she loves her father "dearer than eyesight" Eyes/blindness/etc.
- Re above, if we take seriously the idea that the king has a special relationship with the gods--if people believed that, whether or not it was true--it makes sense that Lear's curse frightens and enrages Goneril.

## Regan
- Regan manipulates men to have feelings. She's flirty and sexual. 
- Before Cordelia, Regan would have taken on the role of the child.
- Lear says Regan has a "tender-hafted nature," which she doesn't, but maybe that's her pose, as opposed to Goneril's more steely one? "Her eyes are fierce, but thine / Do comfort and not burn" 

## Cordelia
- Cordelia is about to be married off. She may feel the need to stand up to her father to show some independence. She may want to go into marriage as a woman of will. 

## Gloucester
- The Glouchester-blinding scene is a torture scene, and Gloucester holds to give Lear time to get away!
- Gloucester may be more shaken by Lear's actions than by anything before in his life (as must the others). Lear turns everyone's world entirely upsidedown. This may help explain Gloucester's actions--his quick mistrust of Edgar. 
- Lear, without questioning his own rightness, imposes his will on others; Gloucester accepts the will of others , without effectively questioning their rightness -- Heilman
- If Edgar is "in the court but not interested in the court (see Edgar, below), he and Gloucester may have not had much of a relationship. So they have to forge one in the play. Perhaps they don't have a previous relationship that's fallen apart. What the force in the play is their *first* relationship. Whereas Edmund is a courtier (look at how he knows all the rules of politce address in 1.i!) Maybe Gloucester projects himself and his hopes onto Edmund. He brings Edmund to court but not Edgar.
- When Lear abocates, Gloucester's position in court is in jeopardy. Which may be what he's worrying about in the beginning of I.i. Who is more in favor, Albany or Cornwall? 
- First half: Gloucester's fall from grace. 
- Are Gloucester's other senses heightened after being blinded? 
- Should he do second half with eyes closed/really-blindfolded, so he must be led by others? 

## Edgar
- Edgar's world is then turned upside-down. What if Poor Tom is 1/2 disguise act and 1/2 panic and grief for the loss of his father.) 
- You have to find things that connect the Edgar bits with the Poor Tom bits. One key: Edgar is Lear's godson. Learn named him. But he's not in the first scene. He may have little interest in politics and be naive about it. 

## Edmund
- Discarding all love, Edmund is able to release himself from any internalized guilt that would place restraints on his actions and motivate reparations and responsibility" -- from Gail McCracken Price's program note (PL)
- Edmund may get an idea from Lear's response to Cordelia. 
- Edmund's language in the first part of the play, with Gloucester and others, is very subservant. 
- Edmund has been away from court for nine years.
- "Boogeyman" documentary (about Edmund-like character in pres Bush's inner circle) might be good research/inspiration
- Edmund has a recognition in the casement/letter scene: "Hey, I'm good at this!"
- Edmund's ambition: he's his father's son. 
- Edmund gets himself into a mess by the end -- with the sisters, etc.

## Kent
- "true fulfillment of the self through an act of service" -- Stanley Townsend (2014 Kent)
- Kent and Fool are nothing without Lear
- What do you do when your spouse of 40 years has dementia?
- Humiliation is important in the play. Kent in the stock -- humiliating for Lear, too. Seeing that, Lear must act. Kent wants Lear to do something about the stocks.
- I.i. Kent shockingly addresses Lear as thou
- Kent is called an "ancient ruffian."
- Stakes for Kent. If Lear sees him again, he'll be put to death. Banishment may be worse. Kent *is* service. When he plays Caius, he's doing what he *is*

## Fool
- Fool has a very powerful position at court (with some downsides), and it's all tied to Lear. With Lear abdicating his power and mad, what life will there be for him? 
- Does the Fool recognize Kent?
- Kent and Fool are nothing without Lear
- What do you do when your spouse of 40 years has dementia?
- Fool has been part of the family for a long, long time. He's been Lear's best friend. He hates Goneril but he "pined" for two days after Cordelia's banishment. Maybe he knew her as a child. Maybe they had a relationship like Hamlet's with Yorrick. 
- The Fool becomes more and more mute in his final two scenes until he has no purpose.
- "Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it"
- i.5. Everything stripped away. Learn and the Fool talking like two old friends, and one of them says "I hope I don't go mad."
